GSC is the scripting language that is used in Black Ops 3 and writes like C# or C++. However documentation detailing methods or functions that can used is basically nonexistent outside some text files that are included with the mod tools which usually led to more questions than answers in my experience. Therefore because of this lack of documentation I relied heavily on just trying things and seeing what worked and what did not. There is also luckily an activate modding community around this game which was a huge boon in this project as I was able to ask questions to people more experienced then in me in GSC. Overall I a very happy with how this mod came out and happy that my friends got some enjoyment out of it as well as the steam users who have downloaded it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="trailer">Trailer<a href="#trailer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Trailer" title="Direct link to Trailer">​</a></h2><p>I made a short trailer for this mod when I launched and you view it below.</p><div class="container_o40c"><iframe class="responsiveEmbed_tj6S" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c54Te5e5iPo" allow="fullscreen"></iframe></div><br><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="play-the-mod">Play the Mod<a href="#play-the-mod" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Play the Mod" title="Direct link to Play the Mod">​</a></h2><p>If you own Black Ops 3 on Steam you can play this mod yourself.
