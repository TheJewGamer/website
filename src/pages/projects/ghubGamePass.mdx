# gHub Gamepass Profile Creator
I use some Logitech peripherals such as their mice and they have software called [gHub](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/innovation/g-hub.html) which also you to have the buttons on your act as different key presses depending on the game you are playing. I also use Xbox Gamepass to play some games and because of how the gHub software is developed it cannot add these games as profiles. There is a way around this and I made this script to assist me in this.

## Making the Script
The script is written in python and simple creates that database entry that needs to be added to your gHub settings file. The script also does nice things like preventing an extra profile from existing in gHub and adds an icon for the profile. 

## gHub Gamepass Profile Code
You can view the code for this script on my github [here](https://github.com/TheJewGamer/gHub_GamePass_Profile_Creator). Feel free to run it yourself if you also have this issue with gHub.
