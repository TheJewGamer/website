# Discord Bot 
Since High School I have been working on and maintaining a personal Discord bot that my friends and I use in our server.

## Making the Bot
As I stated above this has been an on going project of my for a while now. This has led to around three total rewrites of the bot while I learned more about programming and got more familiar with the library I use. This project also exposed me to running application on serverless architecture such on the platforms Heroku, AWS and Azure. Currently the bot is written in Node.js and uses the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library with the [Sapphire](https://www.sapphirejs.dev/) framework on top. Overall I am happy with how this project has progressed as I learned a lot while working on it and continue to do. 

## Features of the Bot
- Text Commands
    - Commands that respond with a text.
- Voice Commands
    - Commands that play a voice clip in the user's current voice channel.
- Games Commands
    - Commands that allow users to play games with the bot.
- Mention Commands
    - Commands that allow users to reference another member of the server
- Mod Commands
    - Commands that only the owner can used. Mainly used for managing the bot.


## Bot Website
Another project I worked on recently was a revamp of the Bot's website. More information about this project can be found its [project page](/projects/botWebsite).
