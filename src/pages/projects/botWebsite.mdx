# Discord Bot Website 
For my Discord Bot, I also created and maintain a website. The website was never in my original plan when making the bot, however as time went on and more commands were added to the bot it got increasingly harder to display all the commands available in Discord itself. Therefore, to solve this issue I decided to make a website for the bot which would explain how to use it.

## Making the Site
The website for the Discord Bot, just like the bot, has gone through a couple of revisions over time. The first version of the site did accomplish my goal of explaining how to use the bot. However, I update the bot every couple of weeks and with how this version of the website was developed it was not the easiest thing to update. This led to me eventually remaking the site so that I could easily update it when I updated the bot. This current version of the website is made using [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) which is a documentation-focused template built using [react.js](https://react.dev/) and most of the pages on the site are auto-generated by the bot's code itself. I am very happy with this change as now updating the website is as simple as running the command to generate the pages and then uploading them to the repository. Overall, I am happy with how this version of the site turned out even though my friends still just ask me how to use the bot instead of going on the site.
