# Discord Bot Website 
For my Discord Bot I also created and maintain a website. The website was never in my original plan when making the bot, however as time went on and more commands were added to the bot it got increasingly harder to display all the commands available in Discord itself. Therefore to solve this issue I decided to make a website for the bot which would explain how to use it.

## Making the Site
The site for the Discord Bot just like the Bot has gone through a couple revisions over time. The first version of the site did accomplish my goal of explaining how to use the bot. However I update the bot every couple weeks and with how this version of the website developed it was not the easiest thing to update. This led to me eventually remaking the site so that I could easily update it when the I updated the bot. This currently version of the website is made using [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) which is a documentation focused template built using [react.js](https://react.dev/) and most off the pages on site are auto generated by the bot's code itself. I am very happy with this change as now updating the website is as simple as running the command to generate the pages and then uploading them to the repository. Overall I am very happy with how this version of the site turned out even though my friends still just ask me how to use the bot.
