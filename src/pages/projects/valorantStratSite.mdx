# Valorant Strat Roulette
One of the games I used to play with my friends was the game Valorant. To provide us an extra challenge when playing the game I created a strat roulette which randomly provides certain rules or a strat that must be followed.

## Making the Site
I made the Valorant Strat Roulette site using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as I wanted to give this framework a try to see if was better for making sites than other frameworks I was using at time.

## Valorant Strat Roulette Website
