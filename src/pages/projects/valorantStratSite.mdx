# Valorant Strat Roulette
One of the games I used to play with my friends was the game Valorant. To provide us with an extra challenge when playing the game, I created a strat roulette website which randomly provides certain rules or a strat that must be followed for the round.

## Making the Site
I made the Valorant Strat Roulette site using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as I wanted to give this framework a try to see if was better for making sites than other frameworks I was using at the time. Overall, the site is simple and does what it is supposed to. As for next.js I thought it was OK but most likely will stick to using just plain react.js in the future.
