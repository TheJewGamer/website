# Personal Website
Yep the site that you are currently on. Like my some of my other projects this is not the first version of my personal website. The previous versions had issues with being maintained easily or the platform they were built on was too restrictive to implement some of the features I wanted to. Therefore after finishing the website for my Discord bot and being impressed and happy with how react and docusaurus worked I decided to decommission my previous and create this one.

## Making the Site
This site like the website for my Discord bot is also built using [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). However this site relies much more on custom react instead of markdown files unlike my Discord bot's website. Overall I am happy with how this site turned out as I was able to implement designs and features I was unable to implement in my previous sites.  

## View the Code
The code for this site can be viewed on my Github [here](https://github.com/TheJewGamer/website).
