# Change The Rules
Change The Rules is a Call of Duty Black Ops 3 mod that I made for the zombie gamemode. If you are unfamiliar with Call of Duty zombies it is a gamemode where you fight off zombies which get increasingly harder as you go through the waves. The mod as the title hints at changes the general rules of this gamemode each wave. When the mod is enabled it will randomly apply an event that can either be a benefit or a detriment you and your team. For example one round you may get an event which gives you a double health and then the next round you might lose all your weapons. There are also events that are not really a benefit or a detriment but will require to change your playstyle. Two examples of these types of events are an event which allows you to fly and an event which makes all zombies ignore all but one player and if that player dies the game ends. 

## Making the Mod
Making this mod was a fun challenge because of the lack of GSC documentation available. GSC is the scripting language that is used in Black Ops 3 and writes like C# or C++. However documentation detailing methods or functions that can used is basically nonexistent outside some text files that are included with the mod tools which usually led to more questions than answers in my experience. Therefore because of this lack of documentation I relied heavily on just trying things and seeing what worked and what did not. There is also luckily an activate modding community around this game which was a huge boon in this project as I was able to ask questions to people more experienced then in me in GSC. Overall I a very happy with how this mod came out and happy that my friends got some enjoyment out of it as well as the steam users who have downloaded it.
