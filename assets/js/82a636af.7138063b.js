"),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"making-the-mod"},"Making the Mod"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Making this mod was a fun challenge because of the lack of GSC documentation available. GSC is the scripting language that is used in Black Ops 3 and writes like C# or C++. However documentation detailing methods or functions that can used is basically nonexistent outside some text files that are included with the mod tools which usually led to more questions than answers in my experience. Therefore because of this lack of documentation I relied heavily on just trying things and seeing what worked and what did not. There is also luckily an activate modding community around this game which was a huge boon in this project as I was able to ask questions to people more experienced then in me in GSC.
