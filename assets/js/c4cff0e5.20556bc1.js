The datapack does this by detecting if a player is exposed to the sky. If the player is exposed to the sky it starts damaging them. The datapack also applies hunger to players if they are too high up in the world regardless if they are exposed to the sky or not. These two changes force players to live underground as living on the surface would be more challenging or impossible. When playing we noticed this provided some interesting challenges beyond what was expected as we could not get certain items easily such as food and leather.
