GSC is the scripting language that is used in Black Ops 3 and writes like C# or C++. However, documentation detailing methods or functions that can be used is basically nonexistent outside some text files that are included with the mod tools which usually led to more questions than answers in my experience. Therefore because of this lack of documentation I relied heavily on just trying things and seeing what worked and what did not. Luckily, there is also an active modding community around this game which was a huge boon in this project as I was able to ask questions to people more experienced than me in GSC.
